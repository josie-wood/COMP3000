*knock knock*
You stand at the door, awaiting a response. 

-> *knock again*
    *KNOCK KNOCK*
    A voice rattles out from behind the door.
    "I don't want whatever you're selling! Go away!"
    "I'm not selling anything! I just want to introduce myself?"
  
-> *look through the window*
    You peak your head around the frame of the dusty window...
    And lock eyes with the dishelved figure sat in the armchair.
    "AAGH!"
    "AAAGH!"
    ...
    ...
    "Can you come to the door please?"
 
 ...
 After a few moments, you hear a grunt, and slow footsteps approach the door.

...
You stand in the doorway.
The pensioner looks at you, expectantly. 
"Well? What do you want? I'm very busy you know!"
"I just moved in next door"
"...So?"
"I guess...
I just wanted to say hi?
so.. hi!"
They don't look too impressed. 
Okay, time to try some smalltalk.

Upon closer inspection, you can see their irritation doesn't meet their eyes. 
Beneath their frown they seem more... nervous than cross. 
Their eyes keep flitting back to the window,
their expression mellowing slightly everytime a new bird appears at the feeder. 
You think you almost see a smile in the corners of their mouth,
but as they catch you looking it's replaced by the frown.
"it's not nice to stare, kid!"

-> "...Sorry"

You look past your host to the inside of the old cottage.
The room is mostly barren, and covered in a layer of dust,
And you can't help but notice that the only used area of the room,
seems to be the grand armchair that sits beside the bay window. 
The walls are empty
apart from one old painting in a faded golden frame
proudly displayed above the mantle. 
"I like that... landscape painting, you have there"
They look almost bashful that you pointed it out, and don't meet your eyes.
"Oh that, yes, I've... 
had that for years.
it's rather old now."

-> Compliment the painting
    "It's really quite beatiful -
    It make me feel...
    peaceful."
    They look surpsided at your choice of words.
    "Really?"
    They gaze into the painting, their face stony. 
    "I'd always thought it rather bleak.
    It's pretty enough,
    But there's no life in the thing".

"What do you think I am!
Some helpless old bag?
I SERIOUSLY DOUBT there's anything much YOU can do for me"
It seems like you hit a nerve there. 
Oops.

You look over to the window
"Is that bird... golden?!"
They follow your gaze to the window,
And then start slowly walking towards it
"Beautiful, isn't it?
It's a goldfinch - 
one of my favourites"
They look down, sheepish. 
"I can see why. It's wonderful to watch."
"Isn't it just?
They usually descend on the feeder in big flocks
But recently this one seems to be on it's lonesome."
You both sit in silence and watch the finch as it flits around the feeder,
Before it eventually flies out of view.

"Is it one of yours?"
They whip around to look at you, incredulous.
"How did you -"
"Just a lucky guess."
They look momentarily annoyed by your interruption, 
Before smiling slightly and looking back at the painting. 
"It's one of the last paintings I did.
It's been years now."
"Why the hiatus?
You certainly have the talent"
"I just... haven't been inspired, I suppose.
Not to mention, I sold all of my supplies a long time ago."

"Well, it was...
lovely to meet you.
Sorry for intruding"
They nod at you, and slowly head back to their chair.
